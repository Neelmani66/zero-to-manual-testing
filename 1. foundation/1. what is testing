# 🧪 What is Software Testing? 
Software Testing is the process of verifying and validating a software application or system to check whether it meets the business and technical requirements that guided its design and development. 
It ensures that the application works as expected and is free of defects that could impact the end-user or business.

#✅ Verification vs Validation
Term                               	Meaning                             	Example
Verification        	Are we building the product right?	          Did we follow the correct design/specification?
Validation	          Are we building the right product?           	Does the app solve the real user problem?

# 💡 Why Testing Is NOT Just About “Finding Bugs”
Software testing goes beyond bugs. It covers:

1. Functionality
2. Performance
3. Security
4. Usability
5. Compatibility

Compliance with regulations (e.g., GDPR)

Without testing, even small bugs can lead to:

🔴 Financial losses (e.g., a failed transaction system)
🔒 Data leaks (e.g., login bypass vulnerability)
😡 Poor user experience (e.g., app crashing repeatedly)
🚫 Legal issues (e.g., accessibility violations)
