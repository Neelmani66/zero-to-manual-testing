## 🔷 1. Agile Testing Quadrants – What to Test & When
Agile testing isn’t random. The Agile Testing Quadrants help organize testing types based on purpose and focus.

📊 The 4 Quadrants:

Quadrant                                     	Type	                                  Focus	Who Performs It
Q1	Unit Tests	                    Technology-facing, support development	               Developers
Q2	Functional Tests	              Business-facing, support team	                         Testers & Devs
Q3	Exploratory, Usability        	Business-facing, critique product	                        Testers
Q4	Performance, Security         	Technology-facing, critique product	Specialized           Testers

✅ What you care about as a Manual Tester:
Mostly Q2 and Q3, i.e., feature testing, exploratory testing, UI, business flow, etc.

## 🔷 2. Risk-Based Testing in Agile
Agile sprints are short. You can’t test everything. That’s where Risk-Based Testing comes in.

🎯 What You Do:
Identify high-risk areas (e.g., payment gateway, login)
Prioritize testing those over low-risk (like styling)
Communicate test coverage based on risk decisions

📌 “I couldn’t test X due to time constraints, but based on risk, I prioritized Y.” — This shows leadership.

\\\

## 🔷 3. Shift Left & Continuous Testing
In Agile, testing begins early—as early as the requirements stage.

👇 What It Means:
Testers attend backlog grooming and planning
Review user stories before development starts
Prepare test scenarios early
Catch issues in planning (not after code is written)

💡 Benefits:
Saves time and cost
Improves quality from Day 1

## 🔷 4. Agile Ceremonies – Your Role in Each
Ceremony	                              Purpose	Tester’s                                    Role
Backlog Grooming	                  Refine stories	                            Ask questions, raise ambiguities
Sprint Planning	                    Choose stories	                            Estimate test effort, give inputs
Daily Stand-up	                    Sync progress                             	Speak clearly: Done, Doing, Blockers
Sprint Review                     	Demo product	                              Give final sign-off input
Retrospective	                      Improve process                           	Talk about test delays, wins, feedback

🧠 Tip: Always give constructive feedback — e.g., “If we get stories earlier, we can write test cases parallelly.”

## 🔷 5. Exploratory Testing in Agile
With short sprints, there's less time to write extensive test cases. Exploratory testing fills this gap.

🧪 How to Do It:
Understand the story’s purpose
Use the feature like a real user
Try invalid data, wrong steps, multiple combinations
Observe behavior & UI

🛠 Tools to Help:

Test charters (outline what you’ll explore)
Session-based testing (e.g., 60 min slots)

\\\

## 🔷 6. Defect Triage Meetings
In Agile, bugs are reviewed quickly so they can be fixed within the sprint.

✅ What Happens:
Testers, Devs, and Product Owner meet (triage)
Prioritize defects: High, Medium, Low
Decide if it must be fixed in this sprint

🎯 Be ready to defend the bug’s severity & impact.

\\\

## 🔷 7. Working with Developers – The Agile Way
Agile removes the “them vs us” wall between testers and devs.

👥 Collaboration Tips:
Test early builds, even if UI isn’t final
Give early feedback, not just bug reports
Pair test with developers if possible
Sit with them when debugging

🔄 Quality is a shared responsibility.

\\\

## 🔷 8. Agile Metrics for Testers to Present
📊 In daily calls or sprint reviews, you can share metrics like:

Test Coverage: 90% of acceptance criteria covered

Bugs Reported vs Resolved
Regression Failures
Time taken to retest

This makes you look professional and data-driven, not just task-based.

\\\

## 🔷 9. Real-Life Challenges in Agile Testing
Here’s what you’ll face—and how to handle it:

Challenge                                            	Solution
Stories delivered late                            	Raise blocker early
Acceptance criteria unclear                       	Ask PO early, write assumptions
Build breaks often	                                Stay in sync with devs, retest fast
Too many bugs close to sprint end	                  Focus on high severity, communicate risk

\\\

## 🔷 10. How to Stand Out in Agile as a Manual Tester (Even as a Fresher)
✅ Always review user stories early
✅ Write clear, reusable test cases
✅ Log detailed bugs (steps, expected vs actual, screenshot)
✅ Speak confidently in daily stand-ups
✅ Learn JIRA, Google Sheets, basic HTML understanding
✅ Be curious, test beyond what's written
