# zero-to-manual-testing
my personal journey to became a full-fledged manual 

This repository is a personal learning journal focused on mastering **Manual Testing** fundamentals.

## About
Guided by expert feedback, I‚Äôve restarted my manual testing journey to build a strong foundation before diving into automation. This repo will serve as a structured log of my progress, including:

- Core manual testing concepts
- Deep dives into **Regression Testing** and **Unit Testing**
- Notes, summaries, and examples
- Checklists and real-world testing scenarios

## Goal
To complete core manual testing within 2‚Äì3 months and start applying for junior software tester roles. Automation will come next, but only after gaining hands-on exposure to real-world testing challenges.

## Status
Learning in progress. Content will be updated regularly or weekly.

üìÅ Old notes are archived in another repo. This one is focused purely on **manual testing** to keep things clean and focused.
