##  🔶 1. Understanding a User Story (The Heart of Agile Work)
A User Story describes a feature from the end-user’s perspective.

📌 Standard Format:
As a [type of user], I want [goal] so that [reason].

🧠 Example:
As a registered user, I want to reset my password so that I can regain access to my account.

🔍 What Testers Must Do:
Step	                                     Description
Understand the story	              Ask: What is the goal? What should happen?
Clarify Acceptance Criteria        	These are conditions for the story to be considered “done.”
Break into test scenarios         	Think: What are the inputs? What should be tested? What’s the happy path? What are edge cases?

## ✅ 2. Writing Test Scenarios and Test Cases from User Stories
📘 Test Scenario
High-level idea of what to test.

Example:
Test the "Forgot Password" feature for valid and invalid email inputs.

📗 Test Case (Detailed Steps)
A step-by-step breakdown with expected results.

Step	Description
1	Go to Login page
2	Click "Forgot Password"
3	Enter registered email
4	Click Submit
✅ Expected:	Success message + Email sent
❌ Negative Test:	Show error for invalid/unregistered email

🧠 Tip: Always write positive and negative test cases.

## 🔧 3. Agile Test Artifacts You Will Create
Artifact                              	Description
Test Scenarios	                  Written per user story
Test Cases	                      Detailed steps with expected results
Bug Reports	                      Reported when actual ≠ expected
Test Summary	                    After sprint ends, summarize test coverage & defects

## 🛠 4. Agile Tools You Will Use (Common in Jobs)
Let’s get you familiar with tools commonly expected in manual testing roles.

💻 JIRA (Most Used Agile Tool)
You’ll use JIRA to:

View sprint board (To Do → In Progress → Done)
Assign yourself to a task
Add comments or ask clarifications
Log defects (Bugs)
Track sprint status

We’ll do a JIRA walkthrough in the Advanced section.

🧮 Excel or Google Sheets
Still used for test case writing or bug tracking when test management tools are not provided.

## 🧾 5. Defect Lifecycle in Agile

Stage                              	Description
New                         	Bug found and logged by tester
Assigned                    	Developer is assigned the bug
In                            Progress	Developer starts fixing it
Fixed                       	Fix is done, tester retests
Closed                      	Verified & passed
Reopened	                   If issue still exists

👉 Defects are usually reported in JIRA, with screenshots, steps to reproduce, severity & priority.

## 👥 6. Communication in Agile Teams (Very Important)
Testers don’t sit quietly in Agile.

Your role includes:
1. Daily Standups: Speak what you tested yesterday, what you're testing today, and any blockers.
2. Clarifying Stories: Ask PO/devs when acceptance criteria are unclear.
3. Sprint Retrospectives: Share what slowed testing, e.g. late story completion, unclear requirements.

## 📊 7. Agile Metrics Testers Should Know
Metric	                           Purpose
Burn-down chart              	Shows work left in the sprint
Velocity	                    How many story points completed per sprint
Defect Density	              # of bugs / size of user story
Test Coverage	                % of features covered by tests

## 🔄 8. Agile Sprint Testing Cycle
Here's how your 2-week sprint might look:

Day	Tester’s Activity
Day 1	Sprint planning, read user stories, ask questions
Day 2–4	Write test cases for ready stories
Day 4–9	Execute test cases, report bugs, retest
Day 10	Sprint review – demo working features
Day 10	Sprint retrospective – discuss testing blockers or wins
